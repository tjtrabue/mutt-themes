* Color Themes for Mutt/Neomutt

=mutt= is a fantastic email client for the terminal, but it's a bit on the drab
side. Why not add a little color to spice things up? This project houses a
number of different color schemes from the community that you can easily
incorporate into =mutt= that will make your experience much more pleasant.

** Usage
   First, clone this repository. It is easiest to clone it into the same
   directory where the rest of your =mutt= configuration resides, such as
   =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt=, but this is not necessary.

#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:tjtrabue/mutt-themes.git
#+end_src

   Next, source your favorite theme file in your =muttrc= file.

#+begin_src sh
# ~/.muttrc
source /path/to/mutt-themes/<your-favorite-theme>.muttrc
#+end_src

   And that's it! Couldn't be simpler.

** Contributing
   I am always looking for new themes, and I welcome any and all contributions!
   If you have one you would like to submit, please open a pull request and I
   will merge your file in as soon as I can.

   Please place your theme in a file named =<theme-name>.muttrc=. We prefer the
   =.muttrc= extension because that will allow text editors with a Mutt syntax
   plugin to properly highlight the theme file.

** Disclaimer
   I do not claim ownership of any of these wonderful themes. They were all put
   together by various individuals in the FOSS community, and although I will do
   my best to give credit where credit is due, there may be times where I cannot
   track down the parties responsible for a theme.
